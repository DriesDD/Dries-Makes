<p>I came across this cool image of Jupiter on reddit.</p>
<picture>
<img src="../../static/img/jupiter/0.png">
</br>
<p>Using reverse image search, I couldn't find where it came from, except that it was a picture from the NASA Juno mission. So I searched the NASA website and found a sharper but less colourful version:</p>
<img src="../../static/img/jupiter/1.png">
</br>
<p>You can find it <a href="https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?id=9123">here.</a></p>

<p>Turns out it isn't really a photo.</p>
<p>It uses real space photos, but a software engineer/ data and image processor at NASA by the name of <a href="https://linktr.ee/Kevinmgill">Kevin Gill</a> maps those images onto 3D models. The relief is exaggerated by raising the bright spots and sinking the dark spots. Looks extremely cool, if you ask me.
</p>
<p>Since these images are already heavily edited, I took the liberty of turning it up to 11. In GIMP, I increased the saturation and contrast, then also increased the colour temperature of the nearby clouds and decreased the colour temperature of the far away parts. Then I used <a href="https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x">a neural network image scaling tool</a> to intelligently double the resolution and make the image usable as a desktop background.</p>

<p>You can click the image to see it in full size. </p>
<p>I'm quite satisfied with the result. However, I also wanted to create something original from the raw NASA data and came up with this:</p>
<a href="../../static/img/jupiter/3.png">
<img src="../../static/img/jupiter/3.png">
</a>
The input images can be found <a href="https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?id=9787">here</a>. 
<p>Aside from changing the colours, rotating, cropping, and adding a background image, I also added some extra depth to the clouds by shifting the lighter tones by a few pixels.</p>
<p>This looks heavily manipulated, but it's less edited than most scientific pictures. In space imagery, art and science just go hand in hand.</p>
