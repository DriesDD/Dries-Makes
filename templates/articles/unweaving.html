<p>This is a drawing I made today, on a boardgame box.</p>

<p>It's part of a nearly endless project I am working on. In fact, I have been working on and off on the same boardgame for almost 10 years without losing interest. It has been tested by my friends around seventy times, and every single mechanic and piece has been through some replacements, so that like the ship of Theseus, it bears little resemblance to the first prototype. However, at this point the gameplay is on version 16 and is as good as finished. Mechanically, I think the game is all I want in a boardgame and I never get tired of playing it. I know, I know, not very humble. Withold your judgment until you try it!</p>
<p>While we do play the game often, my creative work on it has been a little bit stuck in the past year. Seeing friends enjoy the game is rewarding, but people keep asking me if I would publish it. Isn't that the logical next step? I've even been offered help with the process. To take that leap I would have to make some big commitments and probably also some sacrifices. Not a decision to take lightly. Game publishers are extremely choosy about the projects they will publish, and I'm not sure if I have the marketing skills to do it myself with a Kickstarter campaign. But most of all, I also realized that even after all these years I still don't feel like the project is inscrutable. Three reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The game has mostly been tested by the same people who I've explained the rules to. I don't really know how it does in different groups, and if the rules are clear without an experienced player in the room.</li>
    <li>It's still too expensive to make. I've sold one copy so far - at €80, which is the full price of production + shipping + customs. I'm very grateful to the generous soul who bought it though.</li>
    <li>The game kind of lacked a theme so far. Some other games have this too, the generic medieval with magic-ish kind of setting. But I think games with a strong theme that plays into the mechanics are better, so why settle for something generic?</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, I've found a solution to all my doubts in the strangest of places, <b>Aztec metaphysics.</b><p>
<p>I read an article about <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/aztec/#H6">Aztec moral philosophy</a>, and I was intrigued by the very pragmatic combination ontological monism and the recognition of humans as social and imperfect creatures. Aztecs saw the world and everything in it as eternally in motion, and that didn't make it less real - the realness of the things in the world is defined by their potency for change. There is a recognition of the cyclical nature of everything, like the cycle of life and death, without devolving into the supernatural. The Aztecs, despite all their insane deities and superstitions, worshipped very real processes like how shit is turned into plants and death allows for new life. They recognized that the challenge in ethics is not to define goodness, but to learn how to balance ourselves in murky situations. And the more influence we have in the world, the more we are an expression of teotl (the energy that constitutes everything), and the more chance we have to be moral, even if we do slip up sometimes.</p>
<p>To better understand Aztec ethics, I had to start with their history and their metaphysics - how they believe the world is structured. I saw a lecture on youtube by James Maffie, and found out that he wrote the most notable academic work on Aztec metaphycis. So I ordered <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qhkh2">his book</a>. And while I was absorbed by Aztec philosophy in the last couple of weeks, I realized that this had to be the theme of my game.</p>
<p>It fits perfectly. In the game, life and death are closely interlinked through human sacrifice, war, expansion and growth. Players worship forces of nature which we would call deities, and benefit most from playing by the rhytm of their 'pantheon'. The player who builds in five locations with powerful stones wins. These stones are turqoise, heartstones. To the Aztecs, turqoise gemstone was had a very special place. It signified the center of the body and the world, and the number five signified completeness, but also oversaturation, creating unbalance and also the inevitable end of our world, which was the fifth and final age. The game, of course, ends abruptly when five stones are conquered, leading to a fraction of the anguish that the Aztecs felt.</p>
<p>In the box art I drew today I wanted to put the central themes of the game, which are also central themes to the Aztec worldview in general, and to their notion of end-times more speficially. At the heart are five turqoise heartstones, the center relating to the navel of the world where humanity resides, perhaps the force that eventually unbalances the world. The central patterns are the double helix, and a weaving pattern, which are two out of three central ordering forces to how the world progresses through spacetime (or as Maffie calls it, time-place). The third force that runs through it all in the current age, is Nahui Ollin, the undulating vibrating movement which is both ordered and ordering yet eventually destroys the world. Apparent paradoxes and dualism are common throughout the Aztec worldview, with a plentitude of symbolism of inamic pairs. Seeming opposites are often deeply connected or manifestations of the same force. I pictured the cosmic weaving being unwoven, fractured. I took artistic liberties, since the Aztecs never visualized it that way, as far as I know. They were certain that earthquakes would end us but perhaps they never painted the future. The remaining imagery is inspired by the cardinal directions, which correspond to seasons, to gods, to colors and to symbols, of which I pictured one in each corner. For example, in the bottom-left corner we see the South, symbolized by the color yellow, the hummingbird and thorns. An inspiration for this was <a href="http://www.famsi.org/research/graz/fejervary_mayer/img_page01.html">the calendar-map-quincunx from the precolumbian Codex Fejérváry-Mayer</a>.</p>
<p>This drawing made me realize that making more things by hand is not necessarily a downgrade from storeshelf-quality game boxes. Sure, it doesn't have that gloss - but I should recognize that at this point I'm still making a handmade product and own it. So, my materials will be cheaper, the end result will be more personal and I will make and sell about 5 copies to whoever's interested, at around €50. This way I can gather some more user experiences as well. And keep the project in motion.</p>
